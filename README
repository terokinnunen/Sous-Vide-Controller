Sous Vide controller
====================

Sous Vide controller attempts to keep water bath temperature close to given target temperature. It uses a thermometer to measure the temperature and a remote control switch to turn a hotplate on and off.

For more information about sous vide technology, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide.

Note: The software comes with absolutely no warranty.

Requirements
------------
* PC
* PC temperature sensor
* Remote control switch and USB controller & tdtool
* A hotplate
* A pot

Temperature sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SousVide controller supports Phidgets temperature sensor. The needed equipment:
* Temperature sensor (example http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1051)
* Immersion thermocouple (example http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=3108)
* Phidgets Python module http://www.phidgets.com/programming_resources.php

See installation instructions in http://www.phidgets.com/drivers.php.

Note: suggestions for more inexpensive thermometers are welcome. The thermometer should have a Python or a command line interface and should preferably work in at least Windows, Mac and Linux.

AC remote control switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A remote switch is used to turn the hotplate on and off based on measured temperature.

* A receiver (example http://www.clasohlson.co.uk/Product/Product.aspx?id=156771770)
* TellStick controller (http://www.clasohlson.co.uk/Product/Product.aspx?id=157599493)

SousVide uses the tdtool command to control the switch. See http://www.telldus.se/ for installation instructions.

Hotplate
~~~~~~~~
The hotplate must support control from the AC wall plug, i.e. it must not require any adjustments after being plugged in.
